## Acknowledgement
Thanks to [Prime Digital Academy](www.primeacademy.io) who equipped and helped me to make this application a reality! A huge shoutout to Dane, my instructor, you taught me so much! And to my co-parent, Isaac - thank you for all that you do for me and for our family! You've picked up a lot of responsibility while I was at Prime and that has not gone unnoticed.
